robots-hh
=========

This code manages a robot, which means it decides which tasks should be done, set's the LEDs, collects the information and gets input from the buttons.
So for example, this node can abort a task if the batteries are empty and order the robot to come back.

All nodes which execute tasks have to ask, before they start to do something.
